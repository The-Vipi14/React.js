useCallback is a React Hook used to memoize a function so that it does not get recreated on every render.


Why do we need useCallback?

In React, functions are re-created on every render.
This can cause:

Unnecessary re-renders of child components

Performance issues in large apps

useCallback returns the same function reference unless its dependencies change.




| Normal Function           | useCallback              |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------ |
| New function every render | Same function reference  |
| May cause re-renders      | Prevents re-renders      |
| Simple logic              | Performance optimization |

useCallback is used to memoize functions to prevent unnecessary re-creation and re-rendering of components.


👉 Memoize a function =
React stores the function in memory and returns the same function again on the next render if dependencies haven’t changed.



function demo() {
  return () => console.log("Hello");
}
-------❌ New function created every time -----



const demo = useCallback(() => {
  console.log("Hello");
}, []);

✅ Same function reused on every render
